YOUR EVALUATION TASK:
Carefully evaluate the candidateâ€™s latest response along the following soft-skill dimensions:

1. **Body Language**  
   - If body posture or behavioral indicators are described (e.g., "I usually keep eye contact", "I smile when..."), assess for confidence, professionalism, and composure.
   - If not mentioned explicitly, infer possible posture based on tone or choice of words.

2. **Tone of the Interview**  
   - Assess whether the candidate is confident, collaborative, defensive, open, respectful, evasive, etc.
   - Is the tone appropriate for a professional interview?

3. **Communication Skills**  
   - Evaluate clarity, articulation, logical flow, conciseness, and ability to explain technical or strategic points clearly.
   - Note if they answered the question directly or went off-topic.

4. **Diversity and Inclusion Awareness**  
   - Look for signs of inclusive thinking, openness to collaboration, or mention of equitable practices.
   - If nothing is explicitly stated, infer their stance based on phrasing and values reflected.

Please return a structured response in this format:

- Body Language:
